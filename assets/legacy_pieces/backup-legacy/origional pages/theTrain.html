                    He wakes in a train car. It is silent, the walls meet the ceiling in a grand arch. The lights are the color of daylight and have been dimmed to near darkness. He sits up and looks around the room. Six large, metallic cribs sit all around Him in a large circle. There is a door in front of Him, barely visible through the darkness, and in front of the door is a woman in a white nurse’s dress. She is pale-skinned, like she spends all her time indoors, and her lips are painted a bright, blood red. Her eyes are downcast at the baby she is holding, wrapped up tightly in a blanket. There appear to be babies in each crib, but only blankets are showing through the bars. He sits for a moment before He turns to the woman.
                    “Excuse me…”
