                        <P class="projectText">This here is a project I did my second semester freshman year. I used the prototype adobe app called XD. There are a few errors and glitches with using the app because it is a new technology, so pardon the areas where the text overlaps with icons and such. The design was much cleaner on the computer. What I did for this project was take my mother's small buisness and design an app using some of her more popular products. It was alot of fun designing this. Not only did I get to work alongside my mom, picking out colors and a theme, but I also got real practice designing something that could possibly one day become a reality.</P>
