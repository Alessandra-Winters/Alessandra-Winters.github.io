                        <P class="projectText"> This is an interactive comic about quantum physics. Not only did I learn about quantum physics and complex philosophy, but I also learned about C# and unity, how they interact, how to use multiple scenes and transition between them. I also was able to practice art skills that are integral to any visual project. I also learned about audio and how to incorporate that into unity. I learned how to plan, schedule, and manage a large project with a hard deadline with multiple people working together with very different availabilities. This project was a great group project. Not only did me and my group mates become life long friends and accomplish a beautiful comic, but we had an amazing time at the end of the project when we sat down to do the voice over and we just recorded us, as friends, doing a stream of consciousness. That was probably my favorite part of the project, recording the voice over.</P>
