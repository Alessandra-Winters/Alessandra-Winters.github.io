                <pre class="story">
    He wakes in a train car. It is silent, the walls meet the ceiling in a grand arch. The lights are the color of daylight and have been dimmed to near darkness. 
He sits up and looks around the room. Six large, metallic cribs sit all around Him in a large circle. There is a door in front of Him, barely visible through the 
darkness, and in front of the door is a woman in a white nurse’s dress. She is pale-skinned, like she spends all her time indoors, and her lips are painted a 
bright, blood red. Her eyes are downcast at the baby she is holding, wrapped up tightly in a blanket. There appear to be babies in each crib, but only blankets 
are showing through the bars. He sits for a moment before He turns to the woman.
    “Excuse me…”
    “Hush dear,” The woman interrupts. “the little ones are sleeping.”
    He nods slowly, “of course… but I’m not sure how I got here.”
    She laughs softly. “But of course you do!”
    His eyes search the room, then He looks down at Himself. He looks back to the woman and shakes his head. “The last thing I remember is putting my daughter 
to bed. She’s little you know, just turned two. I need to be there when she wakes up. She just lost her mother not too long ago and I would hate for me to not 
be there for her.”
    The woman shakes her head, quickly rocking the baby in her arms “No, no. You don’t have a daughter. You’ve always been on this train. Now hush dear, the 
    babies are sleeping.” 
    He sits in a silent room for a long moment, studying the woman. “Shouldn’t the babies be making noises? Or at least, moving?”
    She shakes her head, “No! Of course not. They’re sleeping!”
    He makes a face of disbelief and stands up, “Do you mind if I check on the ones in the cribs?”
    Her eyes suddenly lose all their pleasantness and turn to daggers, “There. Is. No. Need.”
    He pauses.
    She stands there, rocking the baby, her dark eyes seeming to burn holes in His skull.
    He takes a step and she growls, suddenly no longer rocking the baby in her arms. He takes another step and her body arcs, as if preparing to run at him. 
    He stops and her body relaxes. She resumes rocking the baby.
    He stands, looking at the door, then back at the crib, then at the woman.
    She begins humming a lullaby as she puts the baby in her arms into the crib in front of her and lifts the one that had been in it into her arms, rocking 
it slowly.
    While she is distracted, He takes three quick steps towards the crib He had been walking towards before and peers inside. There is a blanket covered in 
little red elephants all in a mound, but none of the baby is showing. He quickly pulls off the blanket and jumps backwards, letting the blanket fall to the 
ground. Underneath the blanket is nothing. There is no baby.
    A hand grabs His shoulder and He shouts jumping into the side of the crib and knocking it over. There’s a loud clatter as it hits the tiled floor. He 
    turns to find the woman less than a step away from Him.
    “Where are the babies!” He demands as He tries to step back and away from the nurse.
    “In their beds. Sleeping.” She says calmly, but her eyes are anything but. Her blanket lays on the floor behind her, clearly empty.
    “No, there are no babies in the cribs,” He pleads as His eyes dart towards the door.
    She growls and grabs Him by the throat. He makes a gurgling noise as His feet leave the floor.
    “The babies are sleeping,” she hisses to Him as He pulls down on her veiny, white wrist.
    “There. Are. No. Babies,” he gasps.
    Her knuckles turn white as she tightens her grip. His feet kick in the air as he struggles.
    “But. The. Beds. Were. Empty,” he moans.
    Her eyes are sharp as her grip tightens even more and his face turns red.
    “The Babies are Sleeping,” she chides, and He nods in response.
    She relaxes her grip enough for Him to talk. “The. Babies. Are. Sleeping,” he whispers. She releases her grip on his throat and he falls to the ground, 
his hand massaging where bruises are beginning to form.
    “Very good. The babies are sleeping,” she says warmly, a glint in her eye, and she turns back to the blanket on the floor, gathering and folding it to 
make it look like a bundled baby again.
    He stands slowly, eyes locked on the door on the far side of the car, and begins to walk. He glances at the woman who meets his gaze.
    “The babies are sleeping,” she repeats.
    He says nothing and she steps toward him. He jumps a little, taking a half step backwards. She takes another step and he quickly responds, “The babies 
are sleeping.”
    She smiles and nods, “Good. The babies are sleeping.”
    He takes another step towards her, towards the door and repeats, “The babies are sleeping.”
    She begins to hum softly as she rocks the blankets in her arms, her eyes locked on him.
    “The babies are sleeping. The babies are sleeping. The babies are sleeping.” He repeats over and over again as he takes step after step towards the door. 
He opens it and is met with hot sunlight and another door not a foot away. He steps into the doorway and opens the next door, a portal into what appears to 
be a kitchen.
    He steps into the kitchen and lets the door swing shut behind Him. He leans against the closed door and takes shaky, deep breaths and looks around Him.
    The sterile kitchen is filled with gleaming white tiles and shining stainless steel. The floors and walls are covered in polished white tiles while the 
counters, stove, and oven are all polished, stainless steel. To His left is a long steel countertop with steel cabinets hanging above. To His right against 
the wall are steel carts on wheels that hold rice bags, pasta, onions, garlic, and potatoes. In the center of the room is a large white island with a steel 
countertop for a cap. On either side of the island are carts of bread. Against the far wall on the other side of the island is the stove and a large walk-in 
fridge and freezer, all finished in gleaming steel. A small counter sits on either side of the stove, a place for utensils and ingredients to be placed while 
cooking. And on the far-right side of the back wall is another door. There appears to be room in this kitchen for forty or so cooks, but there was no one to 
be seen. The room was silent except for a bubbling noise coming from a silver pot on the stove.
    The Man makes His way through the kitchen, around all the racks and shelves and counters, to the stove and the pot. Inside the pot is a blood red and a 
bone-white liquid that appears to be separated from lack of mixing. The Man reaches onto the counter to His right and makes grabbing motions. When His hand 
comes up empty He leans over to view the counter next to the pot and promptly looks around the room, His eyes pausing just below the island next to a cart 
of bread. Sitting there was a chef dressed in white but without a hat. The chef’s knees are to his chest and his stare is wide-eyed.
    The Man crosses the room to just in front of the chef and squats down in front of him, waving a hand in front of the chef’s face. The chef doesn’t react, 
he simply keeps staring.
    The Man clears His throat. “Uh, hello? Sir? I believe your soup needs to be stirred and I can’t find a spoon.”
    The chef shivers slightly but otherwise doesn’t react.
    “Sir?” The Man asks again and reaches out a hand and shakes the chef slightly.
    The Chef suddenly jumps at the contact, his head hitting one of the metal shelves holding bread, leaving a ringing noise in the silent kitchen.
    “Sir! Sir! You need to leave!” the chef hisses, eyes darting between The Man and the left side of the stove.
    The man’s head shoots up and He looks around, head-turning quickly from place to place. His eyes narrow at the empty room and He turns back to the chef.
    “Am I in danger?” He asks the chef.
    The chef nods. “They hunt us, you know. Us, we who think, who don’t follow their rules, they hunt us. They kill us.”
    “Who?” The Man asks, looking behind Him at nothing.
    “They. The ones who taught me. Who taught us.” The chef whimpers. “You shouldn’t be here. You’re not one of their students.”
    The Man turns back to the chef. “Students? Are you a student?” 
    The chef screams and covers his ears suddenly, pulling in his knees tighter to his chest and rocking back and forth gently. “They made me do it. Create 
something new. THEY’RE GONNA KILL ME!”
    The Man had jumped back at the scream but now reaches out to pull the chef’s hands away from his ears. “Hey, hey now. It’s okay. It’s just us in here. 
Tell me, who is going to hurt you? Not me, I can assure you.”
    The chef gently tugs a hand free of The Man and raises a shaking finger to point, “The knives,” he whispers, squeezing his eyes closed.
    The Man turns back to the stove and looks where the finger is pointing. It points at a magnetic strip above the left counter with four knives on it. A 
small paring knife is on the left and a large cleaver is on the right. In between are various types and lengths of knives, totaling six, including the two 
ends. The paring knife has a red line flowing down the blade and off the tip, seeming to drip onto the spotless counter below. The knives sit still, silent 
and menacing.
    “The knives are across the room. They can’t hurt us.” The Man explains gently as He turns back to the chef.
    The chef opens his eyes slowly and looks at the rack of knives and scrambles backwards, his breathing beginning to race. “Where did they go! Where did 
you put them!” he shrieks.
    “I didn’t touch…” The Man begins as He turns around again and freezes.
    The knives are gone, and a trail of red leads down the counter and across the floor. The Man suddenly is shoved, His body sprawling across the smooth 
floor. The chef cries out and The Man turns around to find all six knives in the chef’s body. He scrambles away from the chef as blood bubbles out of his 
mouth and down his white shirt. The chef makes a gurgling noise and limply raises a hand towards The Man. The Man quickly scrambles across the room, past 
the chef, and to the door. His clothes moistened in blood from the floor.
    He slams the door open, and the next, and practically leaps into the next car, laying on the ground for a long moment, His breath coming in quick 
gasps. He lays there for a long moment, eyes closed, hands trembling.
    He finally sits up and looks around the car, His breathing still heavy. The car has seven people in it, sitting in rows of chairs that look like 
something you might see on a bus. The windows are all covered so no light comes into the car, however, the lights above made it seem like daylight. 
In the last row on the right side of the car is an older man with a brown cowboy hat. He wears a worn, striped, gray suit with a white collar poking out 
the back. He sits next to the covered window, an empty seat to his left. The Man walks up next to him and sits down.
    “I’m sorry to be bothering you,” He explains between heavy breaths, “I’m a little out of sorts.”
    Cowboy hat says nothing, simply staring at the covered window as if he could see through the plastic barrier.
    The Man sits in the silence for a long while, leaning back in the seat with His hands covering His eyes. Every once in a while, He drops His hands 
and looks around the room sharply, before covering them and retreating back into the darkness.
    After what seems like eternity He lowers His hands, eyes closed, and takes a long, deep breath. He turns to cowboy hat.
    “Excuse me for not explaining myself earlier. I would hate to worry you but, then again, I am quite worried about what I just encountered...perhaps 
you should be worried as well. In the last hour I met a nurse in an empty nursery who tried to strangle me and a cook who seemed unreasonably… well, I 
guess reasonably…afraid of the knives that stabbed him.”
    He pauses and looks at cowboy hat. Cowboy hat had lifted his head as The Man spoke, but remains silent as The Man pauses.
    The Man takes an unsteady breath. “I’m not supposed to be on this train, you see, and I need to get back to my daughter.” He reaches into His pocket 
and pulls out His wallet. Inside his wallet is a picture of a cute little girl with black hair, green eyes and rosy red cheeks with a birthday hat on her 
head. He shows the old man the picture.
    “This is Nadia, my pride and joy. We lost her mother not too long ago in an accident with some… natives is the best way to explain it. I need to be 
there to take care of her. Do you know if the train is going to be stopping any time soon?”
    Cowboy hat shifts slightly in his seat. “It is something that is, which is something that does not concern us.”
 	 The Man frowns, “Excuse me? I’m not sure I understand.”
    “It is something that is, which is something that does not concern us,” Cowboy hat simply repeats.
    “Oh, alright,” The Man stutters, “do you happen to know where the train is headed at least?”
    “It is something that is, which is something that does not concern us,” a woman’s voice calls out from across the room, mixing with Cowboy hat’s 
response.
 	The Man turns sharply to see where the second voice had come from, but no one had moved.
    The Cowboy hat turns to face The Man as He turns back around. The Man is met by a pair of blue eyes. Not blue eyes like you might think, but 
solid blue eyes. No irises or whites of the eyes. Just pure solid blue eyes. The Man jumps in his seat and lands on His feet, quickly snatching up His 
wallet that had fallen in the motion, shoving it back into His pocket.
    “What happened to your eyes?” The Man asks.
    He is met with a chorus of voices all repeating, “It is something that is, which is something that does not concern us,” in a monotone voice, as if 
they were reading it off a page.
    Cowboy hat stands suddenly and takes a step towards The Man, his hand outstretched. The Man steps backward into the aisle between the rows of seats 
on the sides of the car and looks around, His eyes landing on the door at the front of the car. However, between Him and the door the six other people 
in the car stand, their blue eyes all fixed on Him, hands outstretched.
    “I just need to get back to my daughter,” He explains, His voice wavering.
    “It is something that is, which is something that does not concern us,” the chorus of seven respond all stepping towards Him.
    He darts for the door, people’s hands brushing against his skin, grabbing onto his clothing as he passes. He pulls away from them and throws His 
weight against the door. It doesn’t budge. He tries again, His eyes madly scanning the room of people walking towards Him, arms outstretched, voices 
chanting.
    “It is something that is, which is something that does not concern us.”
    “It is something that is, which is something that does not concern us.”
    “It is something that is, which is something that does not concern us.”
    He throws himself against the door again, sweat trickling down His face and neck, and yelps as His ribs hit something hard. His hands quickly wrap 
around the doorknob His ribs had found and tumbles through the car into the next room, the door hanging open.
    From the ground He reaches out with His foot and slams the door shut with a click, the groaning of voices suddenly being cut off mid-sentence, “It 
is something that is, which is something that--.”
    He lays there panting for a minute before rolling over and climbing to His hands and knees. He looks up and out a window. The train appears to be 
traveling through a desert and bright sunlight glares through the glass. The Man blinks at the light and looks to the front of the train.
    There, hanging from a coarse rope in front of a large glass window was a shrunken head. It spins around on its rope and faces The Man. The head 
had dark brown hair that hung over it’s sewn eyes. It smiles at Him.
    “Well, hello there my friend! So nice to meet you!” the head exclaims, not looking at where the train is going.
    The Man swallows, “Uh, hi… there.”
    “I don’t get very many visitors up here, you know. It is nice to see a new face. How have you been enjoying your ride? I hope it has been 
pleasant.”
    The Man pauses for a moment before answering, “It hasn’t been what I would have expected, had I known I would be boarding a train.”
    The head laughs, “Boarding a train—could you flip that lever there on my right side?”
    The Man reaches out a hand and flips the lever.
    “Thank you kindly. As I was saying, no one except the men upstairs boards the train. Everyone was born here!”
    The Man clears his throat, “But I wasn’t. I have a daughter back home. I need to get back to her.”
    The head laughs, “You must have met the nurse then. Did she give you the idea that one of those little ones was yours? I must have a talk 
with her. Could you turn that knob for me on the left?” 
    The man reaches out for a large brass knob.
    “No! No! The silver one, not the brass one! That’s it!”
    The Man moves his hand to the silver knob and turns it to the right. The train let out a loud whistle and there was a gentle lurching motion 
as the train changed speeds.
    “Do you know where this train is headed?” The Man asks after the train has settled back down.
    “Ah yes! The Train of Opportunity. This glorious train which has been traveling these parts for two hundred and forty six years.”
    “Yes, yes,” The Man says impatiently, “But where is it headed?”
    “Headed?!” The Shrunken head laughs, tears dripping down from its stitches and onto the floor. “Push the large red button please!”
    The Man reaches out a hand tentatively and gently pokes the large red button on the dashboard at the front of the car. The shrunken head bobs 
on its rope as the train lurches forward, doubling its speed.
    The Man is thrown back into the door with a thud. “Please! Sir, where is the train headed? I need to get off to get back to my daughter!”
    The Shrunken head laughs some more, “Headed! That’s funny ain’t it! Only the men upstairs know where the train is headed. They boarded just a 
few days ago and they’ll be leaving soon to board another train.”
    The Man nods and heads towards the ladder on the right wall that leads to a hatch in the roof.
    The Shrunken head continues to laugh and bob on its rope as it turns back to the tracks, “Oh beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves 
of—” it sings.
    The Head’s voice fades as The Man climbs up the ladder and through the hatch, up onto the roof.
    In front of Him, as He faces away from the front of the train, are three hobos sitting around a campfire holding newspapers.
    One has dreadlocks, his face slightly black from dirt and soot. Another has a large grey mustache with twigs sticking out of it. The last 
one is a grimy little boy, no older than 14, who is chewing tobacco.
    Dreadlocks clears his throat, a gruff, nasty sound. “Who are you?”
    The Man points to himself, His eyebrows raised. “Me? Who am I?”
    The boy nods and spits over the side of the train. Mustache puts his hands on his hips.
    The Man points to the three of them, “Who are you?”
    “Reporters,” Mustache replies simply.
    “We watch and record where the trains all go,” the boy mumbles around a plug of tobacco.
    Dreadlocks nods.
    “Where is the train going?” The Man asks hurriedly, and the three hobos all look at their papers.
    “Nowhere. We are going nowhere,” mustache reads harshly.
    Dreadlocks coughs, a raspy, rattling noise, “We are heading to great places. A place of adventure.”
    “We’re driving into a mountain,” the boy reads bluntly, and the other three glare at him. He hunches his shoulders and spits timidly over 
the side of the train again.
    “Everyone has been on this train their whole lives and, as far as I can tell, none of them have evolved. They remain the same. The train 
is headed nowhere,” mustache growls.
    Dreadlocks gives mustache a shove. “Idiot. We are going great places! Everyone is just tired of being cooped up inside. Just wait ‘til 
they see the mansions on the hills they will soon live in. Everyone is already there from the trains before us. Can’t you imagine when they 
see the grandeur to come? Their spirits will surely be lifted!”
    “The train is gonna hit a mountain and everyone on it will die,” the boy sighs as he sits down, scratching notes into the newspaper he was 
holding with a charcoal stick.
    “Ignore the boy,” dreadlocks explains.
    “He knows very little about the trains,” mustache explains giving the boy a kick.
    The boy winces at the foot and shoves the newspaper into his belt. “We best be going if we want to survive,” he says as he barrel-rolls off the side of 
the train.
    Dreadlocks takes a step to the side the boy had disappeared behind and laughs, shoving the newspaper into his pants, “Oh that silly boy. He has much to 
learn,” he chides as he jumps off the edge.
    “He certainly does,” mustache agrees, gently placing the newspaper in his shirt, as he too steps off the side of the train and disappears.
    The Man turns around and finds Himself facing a lone mountain in the desert landscape.
    And the train is headed straight for it.
