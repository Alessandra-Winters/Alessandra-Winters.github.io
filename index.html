                <p>
                    After spending the past 22 years trying to answer this question, once posed by a very wise and very
                    strange caterpillar, I now feel it is time for me to explain who I am, why I created this website to
                    brag about my projects, and share with the world my mind of creative chaos.
                <p>
                    I graduated High School in Idaho during the 2020 pandemic. This was fine as I disliked the confines
                    of high school and had no desire to appear at a graduation celebrating it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then proceeded to defer my first year at Boise State to pursue an associates degree in Automotive
                    Technologies. I discovered that while I love working on cars I wanted to be more creative
                    (I also discovered that dish soap is good at getting rid of grease, but hard on hair).
                </p>
                <P>
                    After making the discovery that being a mechanic would eventually destroy both my hair and all the
                    bones in my hands, I proceeded to drop out of auto shop and enroll in the Games, Interactive Media,
                    and Mobile Technologies (GIMM) program at Boise State University with a Minor in Creative Writing.
                    My official transcripts claim I was a Creative Writing Major for the first year of my degree, but I
                    knew once I saw the glowing sign telling me the directions to the GIMM Lab that I would never be
                    just a Creative Writing major, I was destined for much greater things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GIMM taught me many important things. The first of which is that Game Design is hard and there is
                    never a “right answer”, there are easier and harder ways to do things and sometimes the “easy way”
                    is a lot harder than the hard way-- but it saves a lot of time in the future to do it the easy way.
                    GIMM thenproceeded to give me a solid crash course in both C# and Unity. After having stumbled my
                    way through my first year I came out knowing C#, Unity, and a solid handful of adobe products. Over
                    the next three years I learned web development, 3-D modeling, how to program in Swift for apple
                    products, how to program for Meta Quests, how to code in C++, how to build controllers out of
                    Arduinos, Unreal, how to write fiction and poetry, how to program for the Microsoft HoloLens 2, how
                    to conduct UI and UX testing, logo design, pixel art, what makes a good game, a good story, and what
                    “weird sugar” is.
