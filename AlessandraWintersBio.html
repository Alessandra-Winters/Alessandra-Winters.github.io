                            My name is Alessandra Winters. I am 21 years old. I have lived in Meridian, Idaho (near Boise) for 5 years. I graduated from High School in 2020 at the height of the pandemic. I love stories. I fully believe everyone has a story to tell and that if you heard everyone’s story there isn’t a person you wouldn’t love. I love telling stories, writing is one of my passions. My major is GIMM (Games Interactive Media and Mobile Technologies). My minor is Creative Writing. I love RPG style video games. My favorite is Horizon Zero Dawn. I would love my career to allow me to use my story writing skills and knowledge of video games to help design and write RPG style games like Horizon or Witcher III. 
                            The purpose of this website is to show case some of my narrative abilities as well as my abilities in the techfield, especially in regards to video games and the skills necessary to build, design, and program them.
